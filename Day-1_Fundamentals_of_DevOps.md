What is DevOps?
DevOps is described not just as a set of tools, but as a culture and practice adopted by an organization to increase its ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

The Core Definition: It is a process of improving application delivery by ensuring a combination of:

Automation: Reducing manual labor to speed up the manufacturing and deployment process.

Quality: Maintaining high standards for the software being delivered.

Continuous Monitoring (Observability): Ensuring that if something fails, it is reported and addressed immediately.

Continuous Testing: Validating that the automation and the code are correct at every stage.

Why DevOps? (The Evolution)
The need for DevOps arose from the inefficiencies of the traditional software delivery model (approx. 10+ years ago).

Traditional Model (Pre-DevOps):

Multiple siloed roles were involved: Developers, System Administrators, Build and Release Engineers, and Testers.

The Problem: Because different teams handled different parts of the process manually, delivering a single update could take weeks or even months. Communication gaps and manual handovers led to slow and error-prone releases.

The DevOps Solution:

It merges these roles into a unified culture.

By automating the path from a developer’s laptop to the production server (where the customer sees it), organizations can reduce delivery times from weeks to just days or even hours.

The Four Pillars of DevOps
As a DevOps engineer, your goal is to ensure these four elements are integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Automation: Eliminating manual steps in the pipeline.

Quality: Ensuring code quality is maintained through the process.

Monitoring: Keeping a constant eye on system health.

Testing: Implementing automated tests to catch bugs early.

Interview Tips: Introducing Yourself as a DevOps Engineer
The video provides a strategy for how to present yourself for a professional role:

Be Honest about Experience: Don't claim 10+ years in DevOps since the field only became mainstream about 7–8 years ago.

Mention Your Background: Explain if you transitioned from System Administration, Java/Python development, or Build and Release engineering. This helps interviewers understand your technical strengths (e.g., server management vs. coding).

Focus on Roles & Responsibilities: Instead of just listing tools, explain that you "take care of automation," "ensure continuous monitoring," and "maintain application quality."

Tooling (Optional for Intro): While you can mention platforms like GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Ansible, or Terraform, the focus should first be on the value you provide to the delivery process.

Summary of the Day-1 Goal
The primary objective of a DevOps engineer is to fasten the process of delivery while maintaining stability and quality, moving away from slow, manual legacy systems to automated, efficient workflows.
